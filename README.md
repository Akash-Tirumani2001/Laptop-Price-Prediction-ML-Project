# Laptop-Price-Prediction-ML-Project
This project uses machine learning to predict the price of laptops based on key specifications such as RAM, storage type, processor, screen size, and brand. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training (Linear Regression, Random Forest), and performance evaluation.
Tools used include Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib, making it a great showcase for data science and regression modeling skills.
